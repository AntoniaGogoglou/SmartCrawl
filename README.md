# SmartCrawl
This is a series of easy to use scripts that utilize Python's BeautifulSoup and Selenium to crawl dynamically defined Javascript webpages (e.g. Microsoft Academic Search) and follow multiple links parsing and extracting only the useful information.


There are two different scripts, one that loads information from file and types it into the search bar of a webpage to extract the resulting URL and a second one to utilize this URL and extract relevant pieces from the HTML source code.
